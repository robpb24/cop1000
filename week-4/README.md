# To Do List

1. If you haven't yet complete your first project, take an extra week to finish it. Here are the instructions again if you need them:
  1. Complete the project: [Your First Web Site](/docs/project1.md)
  1. Ensure your web site has been published, and an issue has been created in the class repo as described in the project instructions.
  1. Look for open issues labeled [project-1](https://github.com/cop1000/cop1000/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject-1) so you can help :eyes: over other students' projects.
1. In [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com), complete the `Basic JavaScript` lessons within the `Front End Development Certification` section.
